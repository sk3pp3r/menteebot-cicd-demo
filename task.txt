DevOps Interview Question: Git, Docker, CI/CD, and Cloud Implementation
Scenario:
Imagine you're a DevOps engineer starting a new greenfield project. The development team is beginning to write their first microservice in Python (you can assume a simple hello_world.py script). They need a robust and automated way to manage their code, containerize their application, build artifacts, and deploy them to a cloud environment.
Task:
Your task is to demonstrate your understanding and practical skills by performing the following:
GitHub Repository Setup:


Create a new, public repository in your personal GitHub account. Name it something descriptive, like my-devops-cicd-demo.
Initialize this repository with a README.md file and a .gitignore file (appropriate for Python projects).
Add a simple Python script (e.g., hello_world.py that just prints "Hello from CI/CD!") to the repository.
Include a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image for your hello_world.py application.
CI/CD Pipeline with Docker and Versioning (Cloud-focused):


Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, containerizes, and deploys your hello_world.py application.
This pipeline should be triggered by pushes to the main branch of your GitHub repository.
The pipeline must build a Docker image of your application.
Crucially, the pipeline must incorporate a versioning strategy (Major.Minor.Patch - e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0) for both the application and the Docker image. Explain how your versioning scheme works and how it's integrated into the pipeline.
The pipeline must be implemented using AWS cloud services.
Deployment Target (Simplified): For this exercise, a simple deployment target for your Docker image is sufficient. This could be pushing the image to a container registry and potentially deploying it to a basic compute service. Please state your chosen deployment target clearly.
Deliverables:
Please be prepared to:
Share the URL of your GitHub repository.
Walk through your GitHub repository and explain:
The project structure, including your Dockerfile.
Your CI/CD configuration files (e.g., build specifications, pipeline definitions).
How you implemented the versioning strategy for both the application and the Docker image.
Explain the architecture of your CI/CD pipeline in AWS:
Which AWS services are you using and why did you choose them?
How do they connect and interact?
How does the Docker image building and pushing fit into the pipeline?
How does the versioning strategy manifest in the AWS services (e.g., image tags in ECR, deployed service versions)?
Demonstrate a successful pipeline run:
Make a small change to your hello_world.py file or Dockerfile.
Push the change to GitHub.
Show the pipeline executing successfully in the AWS console, including the Docker image build and push steps.
Show the updated version reflected in your chosen deployment target (e.g., a new image tag in ECR, an updated running container).
Discuss strategies to optimize and reduce the build times for workflows and docker images builds.
Describe a strategy for exposing the deployed service in AWS, including potential access considerations.
Discuss challenges and considerations:
What were the biggest challenges you faced during this task?
How would you enhance this pipeline for a production environment (e.g., testing, security, rollback, blue/green deployments, container orchestration)?
How could you automate the creation of the AWS infrastructure for this pipeline (e.g., using Infrastructure as Code tools like CloudFormation or Terraform)?
